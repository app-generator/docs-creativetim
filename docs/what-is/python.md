title: What is Python

# [Python](https://www.python.org/)

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose coding language—which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development.

<br />

## Can be used for things like

- Back end (or server-side) web and mobile app development
- Desktop apps and software development
- Processing big data and performing mathematical computations
- Writing system scripts (creating instructions that tell a computer system to “do” something)

<br />

## [Install Python](/how-to/install-python)

The **Python** can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.python.org/). Choose the installer for your operating system, download, and click a few times. By typing python --version in a terminal window, you should see something like this:

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.7.2
```

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Full-stack framework Django is one of the most beloved web development frameworks for developing Python applications.
- [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/) - Microframework Aimed at rapidly building web APIs, Falcon is another widely used Python framework.
- [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) - Dash is an open-source Python-based framework for building analytical web applications. It is an ideal Python framework for data scientists that aren’t much into the mechanics of web development.
