title: What is Eleventy (11ty)

# [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.io/)

Eleventy was created to be a JavaScript alternative to Jekyll. It’s zero-config by default but has flexible configuration options. Eleventy works with your project’s existing directory structure.

Eleventy uses independent template engines. We don’t want to hold your content hostage. If you decide to use something else later, having your content decoupled in this way will make migration easier. Eleventy works with multiple template languages. You can pick one or use them all together in a single project: `html`, `Markdown`, `Liquid`, `Mustache`.
