## Prepare your environment
---

The product is built on top of [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), a popular Python Web Framework. To build the app, Python3 should be installed properly in the workstation. If you are not sure if Python is properly installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. The full-list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - the programming language used to code the app
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- A [Github](https://github.com/) account - the invitation to the source code, will be sent on your account.
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.

<br />

> Check Python (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check Python version
$ python --version
Python 3.7.2 # <--- All good
```

<br />

> Check GIT command tool (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check git
$ git --version
$ git version 2.10.1.windows.1 # <--- All good
```

<br />

## Project Structure
---

The boilerplate code is built with a modular structure that follows the recommended pattern used by many open-source projects. The most important files and  directories are shown below:

<br />

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >                          # application root folder
    |
    |--- app/__init__.py                  # application constructor  
    |--- app//assets                      # Img, CSS, Janascript files
    |--- app/templates                    # Jinja2 files
    |            |---<includes>           # Page chunks, components
    |            |---<layouts>            # Layouts
    |            |---<pages>              # Pages
    |                |---- index.html     # Main dashboard page
    |                |---- login.html     # Login page
    |                |---- register.html  # Registration Page
    |                |---- tables.html    # UI Tables
    |                |---- charts.html    # Charts
    |
    |--- requirements.txt                 # Modules and dependencies
    |
    |--- run.py                           # bootstrap the app
    |
    |-----------------------------
```

## Build from sources
---

```bash
$ # Clone the sources
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-dashboard-adminlte.git
$ cd flask-dashboard-adminlte
$
$ # Virtualenv modules installation (Unix based systems)
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
$ source env/bin/activate
$
$ # Virtualenv modules installation (Windows based systems)
$ # virtualenv --no-site-packages env
$ # .\env\Scripts\activate
$
$ # Install requirements
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$
$ # Set the FLASK_APP environment variable
$ (Unix/Mac) export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ (Windows) set FLASK_APP=run.py
$ (Powershell) $env:FLASK_APP = ".\run.py"
$
$ # Set up the DEBUG environment
$ # (Unix/Mac) export FLASK_ENV=development
$ # (Windows) set FLASK_ENV=development
$ # (Powershell) $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
$
$ # Run the application
$ # --host=0.0.0.0 - expose the app on all network interfaces (default 127.0.0.1)
$ # --port=5000    - specify the app port (default 5000)  
$ flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
$
$ # Access the app in browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

<br />

## Deployment
---

The app is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/).

<br />

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) execution
---

The application can be easily executed in a docker container. The steps:

> Get the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-dashboard-adminlte.git
$ cd flask-dashboard-adminlte
```

> Start the app in Docker

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose pull && sudo docker-compose build && sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:5005` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

<br />

### [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
---

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```
> Start the app using gunicorn binary

```bash
$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8001 run:app
Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


<br />

### [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/)
---

Waitress (Gunicorn equivalent for Windows) is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones that live in the Python standard library.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install waitress
```
> Start the app using [waitress-serve](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/runner.html)

```bash
$ waitress-serve --port=8001 run:app
Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

### [Flask Framework](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

[Flask](/what-is/flask) is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

## [What is dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

In information technology, a **[dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))** is a user interface that, somewhat resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents information in a way that is easy to read. However, a computer dashboard is more likely to be interactive than an automobile dashboard (unless it is also computer-based). To some extent, most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard - by [Techtarget](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/dashboard)
