## What is [JAMstack](/what-is/jamstack/)

**JAMstack** stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. The term was coined by Mathias Biilmann to describe a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup. The **JAMstack** approach can also improve your app's security posture since static sites generally have a small attack vector.
