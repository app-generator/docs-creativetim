## App Forms
---

The file **`app/forms.py`** defines the table(s) used by the application. Being a simple starter, by default the following forms are defined:

- Form #1 - **LoginForm** with fields:
    - username
    - password

<br />

- Form #2 - **RegisterForm** with fields:
    - name - The friendly name
    - username - used to authenticate
    - password - used to authenticate
    - email

<br />
