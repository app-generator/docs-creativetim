## App Tables
---

The file **`app/base/models.py`** (Base Blueprint) defines the table(s) used by the application. Being a simple starter, by default the following tabes are defined:

- Table #1 - **User** with fields:
    - Id - Primary key, unique
    - user - Store the username
    - email - The email address
    - password - Hashed password
