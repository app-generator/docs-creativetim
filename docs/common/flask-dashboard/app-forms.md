## App Forms
---

The file **`app/base/forms.py`** (Base Blueprint) defines the table(s) used by the application. Being a simple starter, by default the following forms are defined:

- Form #1 - **LoginForm** with fields:
    - username
    - password

<br />

- Form #2 - **RegisterForm** with fields:
    - username - used to authenticate
    - email    - email address
    - password - used to authenticate

<br />
