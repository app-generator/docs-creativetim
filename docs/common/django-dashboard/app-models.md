## App Tables
---

The tables created by the Django migration are generated by the default modules that handles the authentication, session management and permissions:

- [`django.contrib.auth`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/#django-contrib-auth) - Django middleware app that implements authentication
- `django.contrib.sessions` - Django middleware app that implements session management
