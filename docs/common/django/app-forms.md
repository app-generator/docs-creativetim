## App Forms

The file **`authentication/forms.py`** defines the table(s) used by the application. Being a simple starter, by default the following forms are defined:

- Form #1 - **LoginForm** with fields:
    - username
    - password

<br />

- Form #2 - **SignUpForm** with fields:
    - name - The friendly name
    - email - eMail address
    - username  - used to authenticate
    - password1 - used to authenticate
    - password2 - passwork check field

<br />
