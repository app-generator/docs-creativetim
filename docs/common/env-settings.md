To use the stater, [Python3](https://www.python.org/) should be installed properly in the workstation. If you are not sure if Python is properly installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. The full-list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - the programming language used to code the app
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.

<br />

> Check [Python](https://www.python.org/) version (using the terminal)

```bash
$ # Check Python version
$ python --version
Python 3.7.2 # <--- All good
```
