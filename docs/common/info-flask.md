## What is [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
---

Flask is a lightweight [WSGI](/what-is/wsgi/) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
Classified as a microframework, Flask is written in Python and it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
